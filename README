Status as of 9:00 AM 12/4/2011

 - Can import data into sqlite db, but only one file at a time and it needs to be unzipped first
 - SQLite DB grows at a rate of approx. 10 MB per day of data imported without indices
 - Have prototype web interface, but it's extremely basic and will probably not work in practice (can't use it to get lat-long easily for instance)
 - Tried using PostGreSQL instead of sqlite, works but appears to be much slower, at least on Amir's machine with default settings

Tasks for today:
 - Get web version up and running.  For now, all we need is a google map we can click on that will pass lat-long back to the server
 - Get a REST endpoint up and running for the server that accepts above lat-long requests and returns all the data available for that point
 - Add a function to dbinterface.py to query the DB by lat-long
 - Write a script to walk through the zipped files, unzip them, then import their contents into the DB (could be a few separate scripts)
 - Import 6 years of data into the DB
