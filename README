Status as of 2:00 AM 12/5/2011

Some useful knowledge we've gained:
 - Can import data into sqlite db, but only one file at a time and it needs to be unzipped first
 - SQLite DB grows at a rate of approx. 10 MB per day of data imported without indices
 - Have prototype web interface, but it's extremely basic and will probably not work in practice (can't use it to get lat-long easily for instance)
 - Tried using PostGreSQL instead of sqlite, works but appears to be much slower, at least on Amir's machine with default settings

Next steps:
 - Get web version up and running.  For now, all we need is a google map we can click on that will pass lat-long back to the server
 - Get a REST endpoint up and running for the server that accepts above lat-long requests and returns all the data available for that point
 - Import 6 years of data into the DB

Data:
 - Unfortunately, the data is 13 GB of zipped ASCII files, so it's not easy to distribute.  
 	Several of the committers for this project have copies though.  If you would like to get 
	a copy, please contact one of us.  Samples of the unzipped data files can be found in
	/data/test/ .
